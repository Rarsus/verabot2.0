# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visibility, ability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- Trolling, insulting, or derogatory comments
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others’ private information without explicit permission
- Other conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

Additionally, as an 18+ community, participants should note:

- Mature themes or content, including sexual references, are permitted as long as they adhere to laws and are appropriate for this space.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at [INSERT_CONTACT_EMAIL]. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

Community leaders who fail to follow or enforce the Code of Conduct may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project leadership.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org), version 2.1.
