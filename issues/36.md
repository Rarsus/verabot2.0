**Value:**
Improves maintainability while reducing code duplication.

**Detailed Action Plan:**
1. **Analyze Existing Commands**:  
- Review the code for `update-quote`, `delete-quote`, and other admin-privileged commands.  
- Identify commonalities and redundancies in implementation.  
- Evaluate potential integration of shared functionality into the `Command` base class.

2. **Enhance the `Command` Base Class**:  
- Extend the class to handle admin-specific checks, such as user permissions before command execution.  
- Define reusable logic for security validations and error handling.

3. **Migrate and Refactor Commands**:  
- Refactor the targeted admin commands (`update-quote`, `delete-quote`) to use the improved `Command` base class options.  
- Replace duplicate code with new shared methods and base class options.  
- Ensure all interactions utilize the streamlined structure without breaking compatibility.

4. **Test Integration**:  
- Write unit and integration tests to validate the refactored commands.  
- Test edge cases, especially for admin-privilege violations, invalid data inputs, and failed database interactions.

5. **Document Changes**:  
- Update developer documentation to reflect updates in how admin commands are structured.  
- Provide examples for creating new admin-specific commands using the updated base class.

**Effort & Resources Estimate:**
- **Effort (Duration):** Medium-to-high (3-5 days depending on testing complexity).  
- **Resources Needed:**  
  - **Team Roles:**  
    - 1-2 developers to implement refactoring.  
    - 1 QA engineer to create and run integration tests.  
    - 1 technical writer to update documentation.  
  - **Toolset:** Access to existing repository, a local development and testing environment, and Discord bot tokens for sandbox testing.
