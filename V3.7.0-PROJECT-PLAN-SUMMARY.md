# v3.7.0 Project Plan - Complete Roadmap

**Status:** Planning Complete ✅  
**Date:** January 19, 2026  
**Release Target:** Early February 2026  
**Duration:** 3-4 hours (simplified!)  

---

## 🎯 Executive Summary

**EXCELLENT NEWS:** The v3.6.0 migration is already complete! 

v3.7.0 is now a **simple cleanup release** (3-4 hours) instead of a complex migration (12-15 hours).

All code has already been migrated to guild-aware services with no active dependencies on deprecated code. This means v3.7.0 is primarily about deleting deprecated files.

## 📊 Code Audit Results

### Audit Findings

| Item | Status | Findings |
|------|--------|----------|
| ReminderService | ✅ Isolated | Only in deprecated wrapper file - no dependencies |
| db.js | ✅ Clean | NO ACTIVE USAGE FOUND - safe to delete |
| utils/command-base.js | ✅ Clean | NO ACTIVE USAGE FOUND - safe to delete |
| utils/error-handler.js | ✅ Clean | Only in archived tests - safe to delete |

### Current Architecture

**Active Code (In Use):**
- ✅ `src/core/CommandBase.js` - Modern pattern, all commands use this
- ✅ `src/middleware/errorHandler.js` - Modern pattern, all services use this
- ✅ `src/services/GuildAwareReminderService.js` - Guild-aware, fully integrated
- ✅ `src/services/GuildAwareDatabaseService.js` - Guild-aware, fully integrated

**Deprecated (Ready for Removal):**
- ❌ `src/services/ReminderService.js` - Deprecated wrapper, isolated
- ❌ `src/utils/command-base.js` - Legacy, no imports
- ❌ `src/db.js` - Legacy wrapper, no imports
- ❌ `src/utils/error-handler.js` - Legacy, no imports in active code

## 🚀 Simplified v3.7.0 Roadmap

### Phase 1: VERIFY (1 hour)
- Run full test suite: `npm test`
- Confirm 3000+ tests pass
- Check for any regressions
- Verify ESLint: `npm run lint`

### Phase 2: CLEANUP (30 minutes)
- Delete deprecated files:
  ```bash
  git rm src/services/ReminderService.js
  git rm src/utils/command-base.js
  git rm src/db.js
  git rm src/utils/error-handler.js
  ```
- Verify no broken imports
- Commit changes

### Phase 3: TEST (1 hour)
- Run full test suite again
- Check ESLint
- Verify 100% pass rate (3000+ tests)
- Performance check

### Phase 4: RELEASE (30 minutes)
- Tag v3.7.0
- Create GitHub release
- Write release notes
- Announce to team

**Total Time: ~3-4 hours**

## 🛠️ Files to Delete (Verified Safe)

All files can be safely deleted - no active code dependencies:

```bash
git rm src/services/ReminderService.js
git rm src/utils/command-base.js
git rm src/db.js
git rm src/utils/error-handler.js
```

After deletion, verify with:
```bash
grep -r "ReminderService\|require.*db\|utils/command-base\|utils/error-handler" src/
# Should return NO RESULTS
```
